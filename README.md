# StayUp
StayUp is a machine learning-driven web application 
designed to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM) neural networks. By leveraging 
historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, the project 
aims to provide investors with an intuitive tool for 
analyzing trends, visualizing data, and making 
informed financial decisions. The application will be 
developed using Streamlitfor an interactive user 
experience, making stock market analysis accessible 
even to non-technical users. This project aligns with the 
growing need for data-driven investment strategies, 
combining machine learning, finance, and user-friendly 
web technology.
